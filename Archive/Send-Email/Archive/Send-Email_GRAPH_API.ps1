Mailozaurr â€“ New mail toolkit (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) with support for oAuth 2.0 and GraphApi for PowerShell
 4th August 2020Standard0Przemyslaw Klys
Today, I'm introducing a new PowerShell module called Mailozaurr. It's a module that aims to deliver functionality around Email for multiple use cases. I've started it since native SMTP cmdlet Send-MailMessage is obsolete,  and I thought it would be good to write a replacement that adds more features over it as things around us are changing rapidly.

Send-MailMessage is obsolete
The Send-MailMessage cmdlet is obsolete. This cmdlet does not guarantee secure connections to SMTP servers. While there is no immediate replacement available in PowerShell, we recommend you do not use Send-MailMessage. For more information, see Platform Compatibility note DE0005.

While initially, it started as a way to send emails, it now has grown to support a bit more than that. Since I've started playing with MailKit library (on which Mailozaurr is based), I've noticed its potential for other use cases. MailKit supports a lot of features (not all are implemented in Mailozaurr yet), so if anything touches SMTP, IMAP, or POP3, it's most likely already implemented by it. All I have to do is write PowerShell implementation of it.

.NOTES
    General notes

    It uses the same pattern as the oAuth implementation. Simply use Graph switch parameter to tell Send-EmailMessage that it's dealing with Graph Credentials and then pass $ClientID, $DirectoryID and $ClientSecret as $Credentials object using ConvertTo-GraphCredential cmdlet.
