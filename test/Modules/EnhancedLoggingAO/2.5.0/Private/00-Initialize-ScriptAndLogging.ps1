# Script Execution and Variable Assignment
# After the function Initialize-ScriptAndLogging is called, its return values (in the form of a hashtable) are stored in the variable $initializationInfo.
    
# Then, individual elements of this hashtable are extracted into separate variables for ease of use:
    
# $ScriptPath_1001: The path of the script's main directory.
# $Filename: The base name used for log files.
# $logPath: The full path of the directory where logs are stored.
# $logFile: The full path of the transcript log file.
# $CSVFilePath_1001: The path of the directory where CSV files are stored.
# This structure allows the script to have a clear organization regarding where logs and other files are stored, making it easier to manage and maintain, especially for logging purposes. It also encapsulates the setup logic in a function, making the main script cleaner and more focused on its primary tasks.
    
    
# $ScriptPath_1001 = $initializationInfo['ScriptPath']
# $Filename = $initializationInfo['Filename']
# $logPath = $initializationInfo['LogPath']
# $logFile = $initializationInfo['LogFile']
# $CSVFilePath_1001 = $initializationInfo['CSVFilePath']
